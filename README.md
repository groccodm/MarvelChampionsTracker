This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Marvel Champions Game Tracker

Marvel Champions is a Cooperative Living Card Game published by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/). 

The plan with this tracker is to get used to react and bootstrap first, and have a way to track health and status on the different characters on the board. Moving forward, maybe to emulate the Villain Encouter deck. This is mostly an excercise on Javascript/React/Bootstrap than a real simulator, but you never know.
